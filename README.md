# Setting Up a Phishing Campaign with GoPhish on AWS

The aim of this project was to set up a phishing campaign using GoPhish on Amazon Web Services (AWS). By creating this project, I gain hands-on experience in conducting phishing simulations and setting a solid foundation for security operation center (SOC) type of work. 

Phishing remains one of the most common and effective attack vectors used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information or compromise systems. Understanding how phishing attacks work and how to defend against them is essential for cybersecurity professionals, particularly those working in security operation centers.

This project provided me a  practical and educational experience in setting up and executing a phishing campaign using GoPhish, an open-source phishing framework, on AWS. By engaging in this project, I gain insights into both offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity, preparing them for SOC-type roles.
